# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking cancellations and providing insights and recommendations to address the issue of high cancellation rates in City Hotel and Resort Hotel. The goal is to increase revenue generation efficiency and offer valuable business advice to tackle this problem.

## Business Problem

In recent years, both City Hotel and Resort Hotel have experienced high cancellation rates, leading to reduced revenues and suboptimal hotel room utilization. Lowering cancellation rates is a top priority for both hotels to improve revenue generation. This analysis aims to identify factors influencing hotel reservation cancellations and provide strategies to mitigate cancellations.

## Assumptions

1. Unusual occurrences between 2015 and 2017 have no significant impact on the analyzed data.
2. The data used in this analysis is current and suitable for efficient hotel planning.
3. There are no unforeseen negative consequences associated with implementing the recommended techniques.
4. The hotels are not currently utilizing any of the suggested solutions.
5. Booking cancellations are the primary factor affecting revenue generation effectiveness.
6. Cancellations result in vacant rooms for the entire booked duration.
7. Clients make hotel reservations in the same year as their cancellation.

## Research Questions

1. What are the variables that influence hotel reservation cancellations?
2. How can hotel reservation cancellations be reduced?
3. How can hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

## Hypotheses

1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
2. Customers tend to cancel more frequently when there is a longer waiting list.
3. The majority of clients make reservations through offline travel agents.

## Analysis and Findings

The analysis revealed the following key findings:

- The bar graph shows the percentage of reservations that were canceled versus those that were not. Approximately 37% of reservations were canceled, significantly impacting hotel earnings.

- City hotels had more bookings compared to resort hotels, suggesting that resort hotels may have higher prices.

- The line graph illustrates that, on certain days, the average daily rate for a city hotel is lower than that of a resort hotel. Weekends and holidays may experience an increase in resort hotel rates.

- The grouped bar graph analyzes the months with the highest and lowest reservation levels based on reservation status. August has the highest number of both confirmed and canceled reservations, while January has the highest number of canceled reservations.

- Cancelations are most common when prices are highest and least common when they are lowest, indicating that accommodation cost significantly influences cancelations.

- Portugal has the highest number of reservation cancellations among countries.

- Online travel agencies contribute to around 46% of hotel reservations, followed by group bookings at 27%. Direct bookings account for only 4% of reservations.

## Suggestions

Based on the analysis, the following suggestions are provided to reduce cancellation rates:

1. Hotels can work on their pricing strategies and consider lowering rates for specific hotels based on location to prevent cancellations. Offering discounts to customers can also be effective.
2. Resort hotels can offer reasonable discounts on room prices during weekends and holidays to attract more bookings and reduce cancellations.
3. Hotels can launch marketing campaigns with reasonable pricing in January to increase revenue, considering it has the highest cancellation rate.
4. To reduce cancellation rates, hotels can focus on improving the quality of their services, particularly in Portugal.
